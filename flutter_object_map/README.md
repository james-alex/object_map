# flutter_object_map

2-dimensional maps of objects linked by a [Key] and sub-type with
explicitly typed methods to add, remove, and update the map.

__See:__ [object_map](https://pub.dev/packages/object_map) for a variant
of this package that uses an explicitly typed key, rather than Flutter's
[Key] object.
