# object_map

2-dimensional maps of objects linked by a key and sub-type with
explicitly typed methods to add, remove, and update the map.

__See:__ [flutter_object_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_object_map)
for a variant of this package that explicitly uses Flutter's [Key] object
as the maps key.
